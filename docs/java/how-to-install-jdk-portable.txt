1.Download the Java 8 SDK for Windows from Oracle. You will get a file named like java-8-windows-x64.exe.

2.Open the downloaded file with 7-Zip
	2.1 - If the file contents are:
				/tools.zip
		  goto to step 3
		  
	2.2 - If the file contents are:
			   .data
               .pdata
               .rdata
               .reloc
               .rsrc
               .text
               CERTIFICATE
			   
			a) Extract all files into a temp folder
			a) Go inside [temp_folder]\.rsrc\1033\JAVA_CAB10 
			   ...there'll be a file named 111
			b) Open the 111 file with 7-zip, it'll contain the tools.zip file 
			c) goto to step 3
			   
3.Open the tools.zip with 7-Zip.

4.Extract its contents to a directory where own write permissions, for example: d:\java\java-8-sdk

5.From within this directory, search for all .pack files and extract them into .jar files, using unpack2000.exe command line tool found in the bin subdirectory. 
  The following windows prompt command does the trick when executed from within the extracted directory: 
        for /r %i in (*.pack) do .\bin\unpack200.exe %i %~pi%~ni.jar

		also works with
		
		for /r %i in (*.pack) do .\bin\unpack200 -r "%i" "%~di%~pi%~ni.jar"
