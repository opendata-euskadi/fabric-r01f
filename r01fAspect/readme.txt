It's a good practice to SEPARATE the aspects code from the Java code
... this is why there are a few projects_
	- r01fbXXXAspectsClasses : [AspectJ project] 	 
	- r01fbXXXClasses		 : [Java project] contains the aspects implementations
	- r01fbAspectUtilClasses : [Java Projects] contains util classes
