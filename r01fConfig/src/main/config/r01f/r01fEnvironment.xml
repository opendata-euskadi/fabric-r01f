		LogPath config:
			- EJIE environments: 
				Usually the /r01fb/r01fbEnvironment.xml file WILL NOT be present at the EJIE environment so 
				the ${LOG_HOME} will NOT be defined ad the ${logPath} var will get the DEFAULT value: /datos
				BEWARE!!!	If the /r01fb/r01fbEnvironment.xml is present a the environment CHECK the ${LOG_HOME} var value
				
			- Local environment:
				The [r01fbConfig] project will be present in the eclipse workspace and if the /r01fb/r01fbEnvironment.xml is 
				classpath-accesible, the ${LOG_HOME} var will have the {HOME}/log value
				BEWARE!!!	Ensure the /r01fb/r01fbEnvironment.xml is accesible at the classpath
